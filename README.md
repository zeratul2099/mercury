A (partial) rust port of Home Sensor Network 

Uses diesel, rocket, reqwest, yaml-rust and rust nightly. Currently provides only the API for the sensors.

Home Sensor Network / Mercury provides a database backend for self-made Arduino/ESP32-based Sensor Units for temperature
and air humidity surveillance and storing. The ESP32-code and circuit-diagram will will follow later here.
